## DataFrame Summary
The dataset shows that urban cities do more business than suburban or rural cities , based on the comparison to rural and suburban ones ie 4-10x number of rides and 5-30x number of drivers in urban cities . Note that the average fares are the lowest for drivers and ride in urban cities. This indicates that trips are shorter and cost less in urban areas, also that due to the high number of drivers, each employee makes less on average in urban cities compared to rural or suburban.

## Multiple-line Graph
The graph indicates consistent trend across three different city types. Urban cities bring in the most money,second to that is suburban ones, and rural cities is last in row. The plots showsnall three dropping their total fares in March before peaking mid-late February.

The line graph shows the different brackets of each city types and total fares. The lines do follow similar trends through time which reflects the similarities between city types despite the total fares being different magnitudes.
